# https-dev-server
HTTPS development server

# Pro
100% would work for other javascript framework.

# Cons
30 minutes wasted, intended to create this lib so I can use https for magento easily, and realise they use base_url variable to their assets & the assets were blocked in browser since we're calling them over insecure URL. :trollface:
